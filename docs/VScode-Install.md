# VSCode Installation

Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VSCode) can be downloaded from [Download VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

VSCode is a open sourced project supported by Mircosoft and the community, it is available on Windows, MacOS, and other Unix base systems. If your are doing any code development with almost any programming language, VSCode likely has an extension to support it.

The **Moolah** database is an XML based file named, **MoolahDB.xml**.  Having an good ASCII editor like **VSCode** that understands XML will make your life much simpler.  Also if you are wanting to review the **Moolah** module code, **VSCode** has an extension for PowerShell.

After installing **VSCode**, the extensions **XML Tools 1.92** and **PowerShell 1.5.0** will need to be added.  These extension will be needed later when the **MoolahDB** is being modified.
