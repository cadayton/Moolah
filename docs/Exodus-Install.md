# Exodus Installation

The Exodus wallet can be downloaded from [Download Exodus](http://www.exodus.io/releases/).  I'm assuming that this has already been done.

Verify that the application software is located here:

    C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\exodus

Verify that the Exodus wallet data is located here:

    C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Exodus

At a later point in these instructions, steps will be provided on how to move the Exodus wallet data directory to a **VeraCrypt** encrypted container. And this container will always be mounted as **Drive B**.

I'm assuming you followed all of the instructions provided by Exodus for keeping a safe copy of your password and your wallet recovery seed phrase.  Sensitive data as this can be kept in the **PasswordSafe** database.

Now, use the Exodus wallet and get familiar with how to use the application.

If you already have a Exodus wallet containing crypto current, I recommend backup this directory to a safe
location. Then continue with this process using an empty wallet.  Once you are confrontable with the whole process, you
can move your real wallet into the VeraCrypt container.
