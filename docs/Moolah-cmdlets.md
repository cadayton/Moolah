**WHAT!!** This doesn't look like the normal PowerShell console window that has been displayed. Well it is the PowerShell console but it is being emulated by a software product called [ConEMU](https://conemu.github.io/).  If you live in the shell world a lot like I do, I **highly** recommend you evaluate it for yourself.
