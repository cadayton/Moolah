# Installation Overview

The **Moolah** module should only be installed after the other software has been installed and tested.

Each software components should be able to stand on its own and operate normally prior to trying to integrate them together with the **Moolah** module cmdlets.

A copy of the software installers should be kept on the offline media along with the offline wallet data.  Should your computer ever be destoryed or stolen, then you are in position to easily recover all of the needed components.

You'll will need a two or more USB or MircoSD drives for the safe keeping of offline software and its related data. The two offline media copies will be a mirror copy of each other.  Keep one copy with you at all times and the other copy in a safe location. Most people will recommend that the media not be online unless you are actively using the software.  You are the responsible party for the data so decide for yourself.

Organize a common directory structure for both the opened sourced software and its data to live.  For instance, my preferences is to always install opened sourced software into a unique folder, **C:\bin\\application**.  I don't like the default things that Windows does for various reasons.  Some software installers may force a specific installation directory and we can live with it, if neccessary.

It is fairly common for software to offer a 'portable' version of the installer.  The portable version is desirable because it maintains it's needed configuration details within the installation folder rather than populating the Windows registry with configuration details. Often times, the portable version of the software can reside on offline media and be executed from there.

In the perfect world, it would be very desirable to have all of the software and its data located on offline media and only available when the offline media is mounted on the computer.  Docker may offer the ability to keep all of the software and data offline.  Hmm... I'll have to explore that possibility.

Wow! I've barely completed 10% of these instructions and I'm feeling a little overwhelmed. Hopefully, you are not feeling the same at this point. The **Moolah** module is already completed and working on my computer and I can tell you that the effort of documenting the whole process is far greater than writing the code for the module itself.

Okay onto the next step of installing all of the software and test driving each of the software components.
