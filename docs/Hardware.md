# Hardware Requirements
At a minimum, you will need a pair of USB or MicroSD drives to serve the function of your offline media.

The offline media will contain the following data which is updated automatically by the **Moolah** module.

1. **Moolah VeraCrypt container**
  
    This VeraCrypt container contains the Moolah database and the Password Manager database and
    any other data that needs to be kept confidental.

    By default, this container is always mounted as drive letter **A**.  The default drive letter
    can be changed during the setup process.

2. **Wallet VeraCrypt container**

    This VeraCryt container contains wallet data directory of the wallet application.

    By default, this container is always mounted as driver letter **B**.  The default drive letter
    can be changed during the setup process.

    If there are multiple wallets, there will be one container for each wallet.

Additionally, you will want to copy the installer component of each of the software packages that are installed.
This is your **responsibility**.  The module will **NOT** do this for you.

No sense in backing up the data and not the software that is needed to expose it to you.

After all of the software is installed, configured, setup, and working as expected, you'll want to make 1 or
more copies of your offline media.  This is your **responsiblity** too.  The module will **NOT** do this for you.

A copy of my electronic wallet travels with me at all times just like my regular wallet.  You might consider doing the same.

What happens with the other copies is up to you.
