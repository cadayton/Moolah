This module contains a collection of PowerShell cmdlets that help automate some of the finanical and investment processes that are performed on your personal computer.  All of the hard work is performed in the PowerShell cmdlets, so all you have to do is follow instructions on the initial configuration and setup to get the benefits of the PowerShell cmdlets.

My assumption is that you know nothing about PowerShell or even that it exists so the instructions are geared towards the non-technical person. For each PowerShell cmdlet, there is a functional overview of it working, so you can decide whether or not to proceeding with the setup and configuration work that must follow.

Typically, a PowerShell module is just a collection of Powershell cmdlets that requires one to orchestrate the cmdlets together to build some functional solution.  This is similiar to purchasing a Logo set that requires assembly.

The PowerShell cmdlets in the **Moolah** module are already pre-assembled, so no coding is required on your part.

The **Moolah** module is being developed on Windows 10 Pro computer using the **full .Net framework**. I will explore testing the module using **.NetCore** at a later date.

I use the **Moolah** module for my own personal stuff, so I'm very motivited to get it done right. This is just my gift to others who don't have the technical expertise to do this on their own.
